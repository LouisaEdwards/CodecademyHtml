HTML Syntax 
-HMTL is composed of elements
-elements are made up of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag 
  -tags are surrounded by <>
  -example of an element: <p> Hello World! </p>
  
  
  The Body 
  -only content inside the body element is displayed on the screen
  -text, images, and buttons can be added to the body 
  
  <body>
      <p> This is an example </p>
  </body>
  
  
  Structure
  -HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships 
  -when an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element and is nested inside the parent 
  -child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element 
  
  Headings
  -there are six different headings, <h1> through <h6>
  
  Div 
  -<div> is a container that divides the page into sections 
  -<div>s can contain text or any other HTML element 
  
  
  Attributes 
  -attributes are added to the opening tag of an element and can be used to provide information or styling 
  -attributes consist of a name and a value 
    -one commonly used attribute is id, which can be used to specify different content
    -ex: 
      <div id="intro">
         <h1> Introduction </h1>
      </div>
      
 Displaying Text 
 -paragraphs <p> contain a block of plain text 
 -<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML, they're used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content 
  -it's best to use a span element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline (on the same line as other text)
